# Email-Spam-Classifier using naive bayes classifier

Naive Bayes is a supervised classification technique based on Bayes' Theorem with an assumption of independence among predictors. That is, a Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature.

It is a popular technique for text categorization, judging documents as belonging to one category or the other (such as spam or legitimate, sports or politics, etc.) with word frequencies as features.

#Previously unseen records should be assigned a class as accurately as possible
